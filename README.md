one two, one two, it's. just. a. test.

Honestly, most of this code comes from around the web and i still need to figure out how this is all really working... Documentation on md programing is not scarse but scatered around and it does not make thing easy for the newcommer.

Anyway, i hope to grok this and write a little tutorial to avoid newcommers the pain.

So far to compile my asm to .BIN, i'm using ASM68k, a dos command line utility from the golden age of mega drive development.
I test the software on the [mess](https://github.com/mamedev/mame) emulator, it has an awesome -debug switch.
